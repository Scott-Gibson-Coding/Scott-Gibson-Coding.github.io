# Project Description

Following along and building a mock portfolio site using simply HTML and CSS. The course I'm following is -- [Getting Started with CSS, v2](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/getting-started-css-v2/about-me-section-content/) -- from Frontend Masters.

_Disclaimer: The content I will be using will be that which is provided by the course and not my own. My personal portfolio I will develop seperately._

## Topics Covered

1. Creating a relatively simple, but clean looking responsive layout. Mobile first, with some modifications for desktop.
2. Some examples of semantic html markup and good organizational practices for organizing html and css. _(No deep focus on naming conventions or anything like that.)_
3. Light/Dark theming through CSS only.
